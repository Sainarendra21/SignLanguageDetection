# Sign Language to Text and Speech Conversion

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Sign Language Detection system that converts Indian Sign Language gestures into text and speech. The system is designed to assist individuals who are Deaf or Dumb in initiating conversations with people who do not understand sign language.

## Features

- Real-time detection of Indian Sign Language gestures using computer vision.
- Conversion of detected gestures into text.
- Utilization of Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API for converting text to speech.
- Simple user interface for ease of interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library
## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Position your hands in front of the camera.
3. The system will detect sign language gestures.
4. Converted text will be displayed on the screen.
5. The converted text will be spoken aloud using Google Text-to-Speech.

## Customization

- To train a new model, refer to the training script (`train_model.py`) and use your own dataset.
- Adjust parameters in the code as needed.

## Credits

- This project utilizes the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) API for speech synthesis.
